# yii-skeleton

This is a basic skeleton for Yii applications enhanced with composer.

# Installation

For project initialization you can run simply the command below:

<code>$ php composer.phar create-project bartaakos/yii-skeleton MyNewProject 1.0</code>

After the project is created this command creates the two configuration files (<code>custom.php</code>, <code>params.php</code>) automaticly by copying them from the distribution versions. **You should override them as soon as the command is finished.**

# Static files

<pre>
/web/assets
/vendor
/runtime
/config/custom.php
/config/params.php
</pre>

The files listed above are ignored and you should handle them as static content.
